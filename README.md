# DHT

i realised that i pushed four of my practice projects on this repo against my original intention of just pushing the DHT project describe belowðŸ‘‡
This is a project that uses DHT sensor and the LCD display, controlled by arduino to detect temperature and humidy. The project also has the ultrasonic distance sensor.
the idea is to take the readings of these parameters and do something with them. i will add a fan and a pump so i can automate them depending on the readings taken by the DHT.

The distance sensor was is also to measure the distance between the sensor locations, which could also affect the reading. i need to add more code for that.
welcome to share some challenge, comment or some relevant feedback
